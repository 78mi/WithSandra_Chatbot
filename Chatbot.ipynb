      "Not too long ago, cybersecurity felt like a niche field—something only banks, governments, and big tech companies worried about. It was important, sure, but for most businesses? Not exactly top of mind. Then, everything changed. Tech exploded. AI, cloud computing, automation, and blockchain reshaped industries practically overnight. Cybercrime leveled up. Hackers got smarter, attacks got more devastating, and suddenly even hospitals and supply chains were targets. Security became non-negotiable. Every company—big or small—realized they needed cybersecurity professionals. ASAP. However, there’s one platform that’s well ahead of the curve to keeping up with these changes in the cyber threat landscape. Today’s newsletter is in partnership with Palo Alto Networks is reimagining Prisma Cloud, their Cloud Native Application Protection Platform, onto Cortex, their Security Operations Platform for streamlined, real-time security. This means you now have the #1 SecO The technology to prevent real-time cyberattacks is here, and now these are the skills you’ll need as we move into a new era of cyberdefense: AI isn’t just a buzzword—it’s the backbone of modern cybersecurity. Security teams need to understand how to leverage AI-driven tools for threat detection, prioritization, and response.
